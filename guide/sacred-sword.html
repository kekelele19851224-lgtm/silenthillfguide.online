                <h1>Silent Hill f Sacred Sword – How to Get & Purify (NG+)</h1>

                <p class="guide-intro">The Sacred Sword is a New Game Plus questline that spans multiple visits to Ebisugaoka. You must gather five specific offerings, place them at five Jizo statues, claim the sword at the Thousand-Year Cedar, and (optionally) purify it via the Crimson Water bell puzzle. Your choice impacts several endings.</p>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Requirements (NG+)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Play on New Game Plus. Jizo statues only accept offerings once you carry the correct item.</li>
                        <li>You can collect offerings across early story objectives; progress keeps across NG+ until you place them at statues.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>All Five Offerings & Jizo Statue Spots</h2>
                    <p>Offer each item at its nearby Jizo statue as soon as you obtain it.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Faded Bride Doll</strong> → In the open house east of your home at the start; grab the Treasure Hunting Game Key upstairs, unlock the kitchen chest for the doll. Jizo is opposite the red postbox nearby.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rusted Flask</strong> → In front of Sakuko's family shrine north of the map (en route to Rinko's house). Jizo is in the small garden behind the nearby building to the south.</li>
                        <li><strong>Broken Geta Sandals</strong> → Before entering the middle school, at the blocked southern path. Jizo is past the blockage via the long route at a small house's side path.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cracked Hibachi Brazier</strong> → Behind Shu's house beside a shed during "Head to Shu's House". Jizo is up the stairs west of the house.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dad's Old Kitchen Knife</strong> → Lodged in a tree east of Shu's house during "Head down the mountain to Shimizu Residence". Jizo is just back along the path ahead.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="guide-note">
                        <strong>Note:</strong> After placing all five offerings, you will hear the hint to visit the Divine/Thousand-Year Cedar.

                </section>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Claim the Sacred Sword</h2>
                    <p>Go to the Thousand-Year Cedar (west of Ebisugaoka Middle School). A cutscene plays and the sword is added to your inventory.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>How to Purify the Sword (Crimson Water Bells)</h2>
                    <p>Purification is done while chasing Fox Mask in the Dark Shrine's Main Hall (NG+ exclusive branch). Find the hidden southeast staircase from Main Hall – 2F (behind a breakable wall) to enter the Hermitage of Crimson Water. Interact with the stone to start the puzzle, then ring three bells in order, timing each ring with the wooden clacking audio cue:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Bell #1:</strong> Back balcony of the building across the bridge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bell #2:</strong> Tree beside the stone where you began the puzzle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bell #3:</strong> After crossing back over the bridge, on a tree to the left.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If timed correctly, the water turns crimson. You don't purify here—return to Ebisugaoka. Behind Shu's house, a stone basin now holds crimson water. Interact with it to purify the sword.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Endings Notes</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The sword and purification state affect multiple endings; certain routes require a purified blade, others require leaving it unpurified.</li>
                        <li>If you're chasing the 'bad' route tied to the sword, avoid taking the blade—or if you already took it, purify as instructed depending on the path.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Quick Recap</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>NG+ only → Gather 5 offerings → Place at 5 Jizo statues.</li>
                        <li>Go to the Thousand-Year Cedar → receive Sacred Sword.</li>
                        <li>Dark Shrine (Hermitage of Crimson Water): ring 3 bells to activate crimson water → return behind Shu's house to purify.</li>
