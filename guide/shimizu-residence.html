                <h1>Shimizu Residence – Full Walkthrough</h1>

                <p class="guide-intro">This chapter sends you down the mountain and into Hinako's family home. You'll traverse three versions of the house (I/II/III), gather three crests, and clear two major puzzles before opening the room where Shu's voice can be heard and facing the Parents boss.</p>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>1) Reach the Shimizu Residence</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Head down the mountain back toward town, fighting through tougher enemies on the path.</li>
                        <li>Cut through the residential district and park, then proceed to the house entrance to access Shimizu Residence I.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>2) Shimizu Residence I → II → III (Access & Key Items)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pick up <strong>Hinako's Portrait</strong> and place it in the photo room to enable the Ominous Photo puzzle (and reveal a crest behind a frame).</li>
                        <li>Use the <strong>Fletching Key</strong> to open the bird-marked door in the III version of the house.</li>
                        <li>Cycle between I/II/III as required to move items and unlock new rooms.</li>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>3) All Three Crests – What You Need</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Crest from Ominous Photo</strong> – appears after you solve the photo-frame orientation puzzle in Residence I.</li>
                        <li><strong>Crest from Scales Room</strong> – balance the scale correctly in Residence II.</li>
                        <li><strong>Crest from My Room</strong> – solve the 'My Room' logic in Residence III.</li>

                    <h3>Ominous Photo (Photo Room)</h3>
                    <p>Place Hinako's portrait, then rotate frames to complete the composition; a heavy frame falls to reveal the crest behind it.</p>

                    <h3>Scales Puzzle</h3>
                    <p>Arrange the weights/items to balance both sides precisely; this opens the pathway to the next crest.</p>

                    <h3>My Room Puzzle</h3>
                    <p>Interact with the key props in Hinako's room according to the memory prompts to reveal the final crest and progress.</p>

                        <li>Use Omamori and backpack slots wisely—healing and panic recovery are key.</li>
                        <li>Conserve high-impact items for the last phase.</li>
