        <h1>Scarecrow Field Puzzle — Walkthrough & Wiki</h1>

        <p class="guide-intro">
          Lost in the rice fields' fog? This guide gives you the fastest, spoiler-light path through the
          five-station <strong>Scarecrow Field</strong> puzzle. You'll learn how each riddle points to the
          correct scarecrow, what happens if you choose wrong, and how to navigate the fog between groups.
        </p>

        <!-- Overview -->
        <section class="guide-section">
          <h2>How This Puzzle Works</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The field contains <strong>five stations</strong>. At each, read the small wooden clue scarecrow, then pick the one human-like scarecrow it describes and <strong>pull the nail/thorn</strong> from its body. <!-- PCGamer overview & mechanics:  --></li>
            <li>Pick correctly and the scarecrow <strong>points the way</strong>; a gust of wind marks the path to the next station. Pick wrong and the scarecrows attack (you'll lose time and durability). <!-- PCGamesN path/wind/reset + fail state:  --></li>
            <li>All clues begin with "<em>Can you imagine how I feel?</em>" and reference posture, mask, smile, or tools. <!-- GamesRadar clue phrasing:  --></li>
            <li>If you stray too far in the fog, you'll be reset toward the route; keep to the indicated path. <!-- PCGamesN reset behavior:  --></li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Quick Answers -->
        <section class="guide-section">
          <h2>Quick Answers (Five Stations)</h2>
          <p>Use this if you just want the solutions. Details and reading tips are below.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Station 1 — "the most polite smile"</strong>: The female scarecrow with a <em>polite smile</em>, a <em>mask on the back of her head</em>, and her <em>right arm stretched sideways holding a sickle</em>. Pull the nail from her upper left shoulder. <!-- ScreenRant specifics:  --></li>
            <li><strong>Station 2</strong>: Follow the posture & mask hint; pick the one matching the wording exactly (see "Reading the Clues" below for pattern-matching tips). <!-- Consolidated pattern reading from multiple sources; see PCGamer & GamesRadar:  --></li>
            <li><strong>Station 3 — "no boy has ever looked at me that way"</strong>: The <em>backward-bending</em> female scarecrow with a <em>sad gaze</em>, far left — the only one not being admired by a male counterpart. <!-- Space4Games detailed pick:  --></li>
            <li><strong>Station 4 — "the disgrace"</strong>: The <em>female leaning to the right</em>, without a sickle, wearing a sorrowful expression. <!-- Space4Games:  --></li>
            <li><strong>Station 5 — "forced to smile falsely"</strong>: The female with head bowed forward, arms outstretched, a sickle in her back. After pulling, follow the direction indicated by the pointing posture. <!-- Space4Games & PowerPyx ending route cues:  --></li>
          </ol>
          <p class="muted">Note: Some writers describe shoulder or back nail locations; aim for the visible thorn on the correct model. If positions vary slightly, rely on <em>posture + mask + tool</em> combo over exact coordinates. <!-- Cross-check note:  --></p>
        </section>

        <!-- Reading tips -->
        <section class="guide-section">
          <h2>Reading the Clues (Reliable Pattern)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mask logic:</strong> If the hint mentions a smile yet shame, pick the one with a <em>mask on the back</em> (polite face outward, truth hidden). <!-- ScreenRant + GamesRadar interpretation:  --></li>
            <li><strong>Posture logic:</strong> "looked at" implies interaction — pick the one <em>not receiving attention</em>; "disgrace" tends toward slumped/leaning postures. <!-- Space4Games:  --></li>
            <li><strong>Tool logic:</strong> Mentions of harm or labor → identify <em>sickle</em>; absence can be just as telling (e.g., Station 4). <!-- Space4Games + PCGamer trend:  --></li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Full route -->
        <section class="guide-section">
          <h2>Step-by-Step Route</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>At each station, read the small clue scarecrow first. Then scan faces, masks, and tools to match the wording. <!-- GamesRadar "read the wooden clue first":  --></li>
            <li>When you pick correctly, follow the <strong>wind + pointing posture</strong> to the next station. Keep to the path or you may reset in the fog. <!-- PCGamesN path/wind/reset:  --></li>
            <li>If you choose wrong, be ready for a fight. Clear the encounter, then re-read the clue and try again. <!-- PC Gamer fail consequence:  --></li>
            <li>Final area: watch for corpses pointing their arms — follow the chain of directions to the lone scarecrow to finish. <!-- PowerPyx 5th area directions:  --></li>
          </ol>

        <!-- Rewards -->
        <section class="guide-section">
          <h2>Rewards & Achievement</h2>
          <p>
            Clearing all five choices advances the Ebisugaoka Fields segment and can contribute toward related field-challenge achievements/trophies (e.g., precision "acupuncture"-style picks). <!-- Game8 overview + GameRant trophy context:  -->
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Problems & fixes -->
        <section class="guide-section">
          <h2>Common Mistakes & Fixes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>"I can't find the next group."</strong> Backtrack to where the last scarecrow pointed and walk straight into the breeze; don't drift sideways in the fog. <!-- PCGamesN:  --></li>
            <li><strong>"Hints feel vague."</strong> Prioritize <em>mask placement</em>, then <em>posture</em>, then <em>tool</em> — this triage solves most riddles quickly. <!-- Consolidated from PCGamer/GamesRadar/Space4Games:  --></li>
            <li><strong>"I keep losing time in fights."</strong> Play patiently: block, counter, and keep durability in mind. A wrong pick doesn't lock you out; you can always re-try. <!-- PC Gamer general consequence advice:  --></li>
          </ul>
